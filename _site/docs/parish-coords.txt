Using GeoJSON.io is nice in that it provides an interface to drop markers at polygon vertices and outputs GSON, but it needs to be cleaned up for our polygon code and the coords are in the wrong order.

GeoJSON.io can also generate a Gist, which displays as a map! https://gist.github.com/anonymous/820ebf93521d6560411c

We should be able to use an associative array for these, but it's not working, so I'm going to manually flip their order.
